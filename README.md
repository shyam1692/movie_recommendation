# Movie Recommendation Using K Nearest Neighbors 

What is a movie which I would potentially like?
This can be derived by my interests. I can identify people very similar to me with common interests and see a couple of movies which I haven't yet watched and they have liked.

This is what happens in Nearest Neighbors.

I have worked on both the 100K and 10 Million datasets, identifying the most similar users by K Nearest Neighbors.
I have experimented with various distance functions for this problem, the cosine distance function working the best, since it's a high dimensional data.

For 10 Million Dataset, a simple mean across the users work very well, since on an average many people have same preferences.
